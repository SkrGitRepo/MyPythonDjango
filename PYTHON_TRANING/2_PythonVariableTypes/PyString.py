Python Strings:
Strings in Python are identified as a contiguous set of characters in between quotation marks. Python allows for
either pairs of single or double quotes. Subsets of strings can be taken using the slice operator ( [ ] and [ : ] ) with
indexes starting at 0 in the beginning of the string and working their way from -1 at the end.
The plus ( + ) sign is the string concatenation operator and the asterisk ( * ) is the repetition operator.

Example:
"""

my_str= 'Hello python!'

print my_str
print my_str[0]
print my_str[2:5]
print my_str[2:]
print my_str * 2
print my_str + 'world of programming'
